# hello-world

Hey hackers!

My name is Trenton. I'm  attending UT Dallas in persuit of a career in ITS and sustainability.
I like food, but not all food. It has to be sustainable, so I especially like entomophagy, the consumtpion of insects.
If you want to follow my journey, follow my insta @trentonimoore. See you later!
